# Friday Night Funkin Randomizer
This is an unofficial mod for Friday Night Funkin that randomizes notes for all songs and difficulties. 

Support Friday Night Funkin and it's developers on the itch.io page: https://ninja-muffin24.itch.io/funkin

## Requirements
<s>You will need Python 3.7+ to run the program. Install the most recent version of Python here: https://www.python.org/downloads/</s>
You should not need Python installed to run this program anymore. If you run into issues running it without Python, please leave an Issue or email me!

You will also need to download the latest version of Friday Night Funkin (v5). This download can be found at the game's itchio page linked above. It is heavily recommended that you use a clean build and not your own build! Always good to have a backup just in case things go wrong.

## Installation and Instructions
Install and place all files inside it's own folder. Run the "fnf-randomizer.exe" application.

When running the program you should be greeted by a few options to select:

- Set FNF Path: Lets you pick the path for the FNF directory. Make sure you choose the base directory containing the executable and assets directory!

- Randomize Notes: Randomizes what notes need to be pressed
- Randomize Characters: Randomizes what characters appear on each map
- Randomize Order: Randomizes who plays what section
- Solo Mode: You also play opponent notes, allowing you to play the whole map. This will mean that double notes will appear and some songs may be mapped a bit oddly!

Once you make your choices press the Randomize button to start the randomization. The logs at the bottom will tell you if the program runs into any problems as well as if the randomization was successful.

## Common Errors

- "Could not locate proper FNF files": The program could not locate the proper assets folder and contents inside the directory you set as the FNF path. Make sure the path is set to a directory with Friday Night Funkin and that none of it's resources have been altered. 

## Troubleshooting

Q. The randomizer is having issues with certain mods!

A. Compatibility with Friday Night Funkin mods is difficult to add with how many mods work differently and use certain files that others do not. Compatibility depends on the mod, some may work and some may crash certain maps.

Q. I'm running into an undocumented problem or error!

A. Let me know! Either leave an issue on this repo or send me an email at natestutte@protonmail.com.
